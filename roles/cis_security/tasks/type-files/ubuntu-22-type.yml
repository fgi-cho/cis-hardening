# 1.3 Filesystem Integrity Checking
# AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent
# intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the
# files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be
# concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation
# before proceeding.
# 1.3.1 Ensure AIDE is installed
# AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and
# file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to
# detect modifications to the system.
# Note: The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up
# their start up times. Run prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus
# avoiding false positives from AIDE.

# 1.7 Warning Banners
# Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution
# of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the
# side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from
# attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.

# 1.7.1 Command Line Warning Banners
# The /etc/motd , /etc/issue , and /etc/issue.net files govern warning banners for
# standard command line logins for both local and remote users.

# 1.7.1 Ensure message of the day is configured properly
# The contents of the /etc/motd file are displayed to users after login and function as a
# message of the day for authenticated users.
# Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch
# level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are
# developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following
# options, they display operating system information: \m - machine architecture \r -
# operating system release \s - operating system name \v - operating system version

# Rationale:
# A firewall utility is required to configure the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the

# The Linux kernel's netfilter framework host-based firewall can protect against threats
# originating from within a corporate network to include malicious mobile code and poorly
# configured software on a host.

# 5.7 Ensure access to the su command is restricted
# Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.
