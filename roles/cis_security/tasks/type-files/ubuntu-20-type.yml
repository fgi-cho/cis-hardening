# 1.3 Filesystem Integrity Checking
# AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent
# intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the
# files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be
# concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation
# before proceeding.
# 1.3.1 Ensure AIDE is installed
# AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and
# file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to
# detect modifications to the system.
# Note: The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up
# their start up times. Run prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus
# avoiding false positives from AIDE.

# The Linux kernel's netfilter framework host-based firewall can protect against threats

# sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third
